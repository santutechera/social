This addon extends the Odoo subscription engine to provide proof on why
you are sending mass mailings to a given contact, as required by the
GDPR in Europe.

Usage
=====

Once configured:

1. Go to *Email Marketing > Mailings > Create*.
2. Edit your mass mailing at wish, but remember to add a snippet from
   *Footers*, so people have an *Unsubscribe* link.
3. Send it.
4. If somebody gets unsubscribed, you will see logs about that under
   *Email Marketing > Unsubscriptions*.
