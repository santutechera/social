This module allows users to forward messages from the chatter of any
document to:

- Other users in the same thread, adding them as followers of the
  document without notifying the current followers.
- Another thread, but not adding them as followers—only notifying the
  current followers of the other thread.

   :local:

Configuration
=============

To enable a model to forward messages to another thread:

- With debug mode activated, go to
  ``Settings -> Technical -> Database Structure -> Models``.
- Search for the model you wish to enable.
- Mark the option ``Enable Forward To`` and save. Transient models or
  those without mail thread won't have this check visible.

Usage
=====

To use this module, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the chatter of any document.
- Hover the mouse over any message in the chatter (excluding internal
  notes).
- A Forward icon will appear next to the message.
- Click the button to display a wizard with the message.
- Select the forward type (current thread or another thread).
- Select the users to forward the message to, or select the other thread
  according to the previous step.
- Click the 'Send Mail' button to send the message to the selected users
  or thread.
