To enable a model to forward messages to another thread:

- With debug mode activated, go to `Settings -> Technical -> Database Structure -> Models`.
- Search for the model you wish to enable. 
- Mark the option `Enable Forward To` and save. Transient models or those without mail thread won't have this check visible.
