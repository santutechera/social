This module inhibits the assignation notification from the models that
we want.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

1. Go to Settings > Technical > System Parameters
2. Edit "mailno_user_assign_notification.models" key record
3. Set any model\* (for example: res.partner).

NOTE1: It is possible to set several models separated by comma (e.g.:
model1,model2).

NOTE2: The model should have the field user_id for this to be effective.

Usage
=====

1. Go to one of the configured models (like Contacts).
2. Create or edit a record, and assign the field for the user (in
   contacts, it's called "Salesperson", in purchase orders it's
   "Purchase representative", etc).
3. The user won't receive the automatic assignment email.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- This is not valid for project tasks users assignation, as the field is
  multi-relational. A specific extension would be needed.
